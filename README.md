# ElevateHer
A smart journaling tool for personal, financial and mental health well-being.

# Inspiration
Women often juggle multiple responsibilities, leading to stress, financial concerns, and difficulty maintaining overall well-being. We wanted to create a solution that helps women track their mental health, financial goals, and personal growth seamlessly through journaling and insights.

# What it does
Our app serves as a personal wellness and finance tracker, empowering users to log daily journal entries focused on health, finance, and personal growth. It enables them to track anxiety levels, energy fluctuations, savings, and investments while receiving personalized insights and recommendations based on their entries. Additionally, users can set and monitor monthly goals, helping them achieve a balanced and fulfilling lifestyle.

# What's next for ElevateHer
Following WiCHacks, our goal is to move the website beyond the prototype stage by using React or Angular for the front-end, a relational database, and Java or Python for the back-end, all powered by our own model. This will require us to learn these frameworks to improve user interactions. We also plan to strengthen our privacy-first approach when handling sensitive user data. In future iterations, we aim to integrate more financial tools, such as savings challenges and investment recommendations, along with enhanced wellness features.
